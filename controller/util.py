Basal cell carcinoma begins in the basal cells â€” a type of cell within the skin that produces new skin cells as old ones die off. Basal cell carcinoma often appears as a slightly transparent bump on the skin, though it can take other forms. Basal cell carcinoma occurs most often on areas of the skin that are exposed to the sun, such as your head and neck.\n*Type*: Cancerous ðŸ”´"

It's often found on the face, lips, ears, forearms, scalp, neck or back of the hands. Also known as a solar keratosis, an actinic keratosis grows slowly and usually first appears in people over 40.
